# Student Project Guide

This is a guide for post secondary students working on the Wall. Your application will run on a single virtual machine, which spans 3 Multitactions. You will not be required to do any Networking or Camera Cropping.

## Unity Game View
Within the Unity Editor, you will want to setup a custom aspect ratio to view your game.
